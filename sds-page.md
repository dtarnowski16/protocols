# SDS-PAGE Gels

We have the mini-protean and criterion system from Biorad.

## Mini-Protean system

See [guide](https://www.bio-rad.com/webroot/web/pdf/lsr/literature/Bulletin_1658100.pdf) for more detail on reagents and protocol.

### Supplies
-[Running buffer](#running-buffer)
-[Sample buffer](#sample-buffer)
-[gel](#gel)
-[Ladder](#ladder)

#### Running buffer
Typical running buffer for SDS-PAGE is Tris/Glycine/SDS buffer.  

1. Create a 10x stock of buffer
    -Get premade 10x stock from Biorad (10x Tris/Glycine/SDS #1610732)
    -Make buffer
      -25mM Tris (30g Tris base)
      -192mM Glycine (144g glycine)
      -0.1% SDS (10g SDS)
      -dissolve reagents in DI water (1L)
      -pH 8.3
1. Dilute 10x stock to make 1x solution
    It takes 1250mL (not 1L as stated) to fill the tank up to the top.
    -125mL of 10x stock
    -1125mL of DI H2O

#### Sample Buffer
All samples should be dissolved/diluted in sample buffer prior to loading

1. 2x Laemmli buffer can be bought from Biorad (#1610737)
1. Take out aliquot of buffer needed and add B-Me
    -50ul of beta-mercaponethanol added to 950ul of Laemmli Buffer
1. Add 1 part buffer to 1 part protein samples

#### Gel
Gels can be ordered premade from Biorad. Order TGX gels for mini-protean system.  
Choose the appropriate gel percentage depending on the size bands you are trying to resolve. Gradient gels should be used if you are trying to separate bands of widely varying molecular weights.

Percent|Size
--|--
7.5% | 40–200 kD
10% | 30–150 kD
12% | 20–120 kD
4–15% | 20–250 kD
 4–20% | 10–200 kD
 Any kD™ | 10–100 kD

#### Ladder
The Mandel lab currently uses the following ladder: Thermo Scientific™ PageRuler™ Prestained 10-180kDa Protein Ladder

### Protocol
1. Unpackage gel - remove green strip from base and remove comb
1. Set up gel in electrode assembly.
    -If only one gel, use glass casting pieces as buffer dam
    -Make sure wells face inside of the unit
1. Use green clamps to secure gels
1. Place electrode assembly into tank
1. Pour running buffer into tank starting by filling the electrode assembly
    - Electrode assembly should fill up and not leak into tank
    - Wells should be filled with running buffer
    - Once assembly is full, fill tank
1. Add ladder and samples to wells
1. Place lid on tank and hook up to HC power supply
1. Run gel at 200V until dye front reaches the bottom of the gel (30-40 min)
    - Instruction manual says gel can be run at up to 300V, but we do not have HV (high-voltage) power supply for this.
    - If samples do not run evenly, run gel at 50V for about 15min allowing samples to move out of the stacking gel portion of the gel. Increase to 200V once samples have entered the separating gel.
1. When run is complete, remove gel from apparatus. Use green lever and insert between plastic plates where black arrows indicate.

## Criterion System
Used for larger gels. Not yet used in Madison.
See [guide](https://www.bio-rad.com/webroot/web/pdf/lsr/literature/Bulletin_4006183A.pdf) for more detail on reagents and protocol.

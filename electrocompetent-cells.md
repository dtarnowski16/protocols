# Creation of Electrocompetent E. coli for Transformations

Description of protocol used to create lab stocks of electrocompetent *E. coli*.
Below details the original protocol as well as the more commonly used one that utilizes the smaller biobottles.

## Original Protocol

For use with 750ml biobottles. Makes 1L of competent cells

### Materials:

1 L sterile SOB, Teknova powder #S0210.  Or mix:
- 2.0% tryptone
- 0.5% yeast extract
- 10mM NaCl
- 2.5mM KCl
- 10mM MgCl2
- 10mM MgSO4. H2O

SOC (add glucose to SOB)
- Make 20% stock of autoclaved or filter sterilized glucose
- Add 18mL to 1L of SOB

Sterile, preheated
- culture tube with 2ml SOB
- Two 2L flasks with 500mL SOC in each

Sterile, chilled
- 2L of DI H2o
- 200mL 10% glycerol
- Two 750mL biobottles
- Two 50mL conical tubes
- XTR clinical centrifuge with 2 adapters for Biobottles and 2 adapters for 50 ml conical tubes
- Refrigerated (or preset to 4C) microfuge
- 2 ml Microfuge tubes (1 for last resuspension)
- 1.5 ml Microfuge tubes (40+ in ice bucket for aliquots)
- 1 box p200 tips, 1 box p1000 tips
- 2 10 ml pipettes, 2 25 ml pipettes

Ice bucket

### Protocol

**Day 1**
1. Inoculate 2 ml SOB (or LB) with strain and grow shaking overnight at 37°C.

**Day 2**
1. Inoculate 2 x 500 ml prewarmed SOC with 500 μl overnight culture and grow at 37°C until OD600 = 0.5 (approximately 2.5-3.5 hours).
2. Cool culture quickly in an ice-water slurry.
3. Pellet at 4000 x g, at 4°C for 15 min.  Use Biobottles in the TX-450 rotor.
4. Re-suspend each pellet in 500 ml cold dI H2O.
5. Pellet as in #4.
6. Re-suspend each pellet in 250 ml cold dI H2O.
7. Pellet as in #4.
8. Re-suspend each pellet in 20 ml cold 10% glycerol.  Transfer both resuspensions to the same 50ml conical tube.
9. Pellet as in #4, balancing with a blank tube.
10. Re-suspend pellet in 2 ml cold 10% glycerol.
11. Aliquot 50 μl volumes in cold microfuge tubes and store at -80ºC.


## Updated Protocol

For use with 250mL biobottles. Instead of using one 750mL bottle per 500mL of culture, the culture is divided into 3 250mL biobottles.
Makes 500mL of competent cells, but everything can be done in duplicate for 1L.

### Materials: 

500mL sterile SOB (see above for recipe)

SOC - add 9mL of 20% glucose to 500mL SOB

Sterile, preheated
- culture tube with 2ml SOB
- One 2L flask with 500mL SOC

Sterile, chilled
- 1L of DI H2o
- 100mL 10% glycerol
- Three 250mL biobottles
- One 50mL conical tubes
- XTR clinical centrifuge with adapters for Biobottles and 50 ml conical tubes
- Refrigerated (or preset to 4C) microfuge
- 1.5 ml Microfuge tubes (40+ in ice bucket for aliquots)

### Protocol

**Day 1**
1. Inoculate 2 ml SOB with strain and grow shaking overnight at 37°C.

**Day 2**
1. Inoculate 500 ml SOC with 500 μl overnight culture and grow at 37°C until OD600 = 0.5 (approximately 3-4 hours).
2. Cool culture quickly in an ice-water slurry.
3. Divide culture evenly into the three chilled biobottles.
4. Pellet at 4000 x g, at 4°C for 15 min.  Use Biobottles in the TX-450 rotor.
5. Re-suspend each pellet in 165 ml cold dI H2O.
6. Pellet as in #4.
7. Re-suspend each pellet in 83 ml cold dI H2O.
8. Pellet as in #4.
9. Re-suspend each pellet in 7 ml cold 10% glycerol.  Transfer all 3 resuspensions to the same 50ml conical tube.
10. Pellet as in #4, balancing with a blank tube.
11. Re-suspend pellet in 1 ml cold 10% glycerol.
12. Aliquot 50 μl volumes in cold microfuge tubes and store at -80ºC.

# Creation of Electrocompetent E. coli for Transformations

Description of protocol used to create lab stocks of electrocompetent *E. coli*.
The 750 mL bottle protocol was the original one, but the 250 mL bottle protocol is more commonly used.

## Protocol with 250 mL bottles

For use with 250 mL biobottles. 
Instead of using one 750 mL bottle per 500mL of culture, the culture is divided into 3 250 mL biobottles.
Makes 500 mL of competent cells, but everything can be done in duplicate for 1L.

### Materials: 

500 mL sterile SOB (see above for recipe)

SOC - add 9 mL of 20% glucose to 500 mL SOB

Sterile, preheated
- culture tube with 2 mL SOB
- One 2 L flask with 500 mL SOC

Sterile, chilled
- 1 L of DI H2o
- 100 mL 10% glycerol
- Three 250 mL biobottles
- One 50 mL conical tubes
- XTR clinical centrifuge with adapters for Biobottles and 50 mL conical tubes
- Refrigerated (or preset to 4C) microfuge
- 1.5 mL Microfuge tubes (40+ in ice bucket for aliquots)

Ice bucket

### Protocol

**Day 1**
1. Inoculate 2 mL SOB with strain and grow shaking overnight at 37°C.

**Day 2**
1. Inoculate 500 mL SOC with 500 μl overnight culture and grow at 37°C until OD600 = 0.5 (approximately 3-4 hours).
2. Cool culture quickly in an ice-water slurry.
3. Divide culture evenly into the three chilled biobottles.
4. Pellet at 4000 x g, at 4°C for 15 min.  Use Biobottles in the TX-450 rotor.
5. Re-suspend each pellet in 165 mL cold dI H2O.
6. Pellet as in #4.
7. Re-suspend each pellet in 83 mL cold dI H2O.
8. Pellet as in #4.
9. Re-suspend each pellet in 7 mL cold 10% glycerol.  Transfer all 3 resuspensions to the same 50 mL conical tube.
10. Pellet as in #4, balancing with a blank tube.
11. Re-suspend pellet in 1 mL cold 10% glycerol.
12. Aliquot 50 μl volumes in cold microfuge tubes and store at -80ºC.


## Protocol with 750 mL bottles

For use with 750 mL biobottles. Makes 1 L of competent cells

### Materials:
Same as above, but doubled to make 1 L 

### Protocol

**Day 1**
1. Inoculate 2 mL SOB (or LB) with strain and grow shaking overnight at 37°C.

**Day 2**
1. Inoculate 2 x 500 mL prewarmed SOC with 500 μl overnight culture and grow at 37°C until OD600 = 0.5 (approximately 2.5-3.5 hours).
2. Cool culture quickly in an ice-water slurry.
3. Pellet at 4000 x g, at 4°C for 15 min.  Use Biobottles in the TX-450 rotor.
4. Re-suspend each pellet in 500 mL cold dI H2O.
5. Pellet as in #4.
6. Re-suspend each pellet in 250 mL cold dI H2O.
7. Pellet as in #4.
8. Re-suspend each pellet in 20 mL cold 10% glycerol.  Transfer both resuspensions to the same 50ml conical tube.
9. Pellet as in #4, balancing with a blank tube.
10. Re-suspend pellet in 2 mL cold 10% glycerol.
11. Aliquot 50 μl volumes in cold microfuge tubes and store at -80ºC.

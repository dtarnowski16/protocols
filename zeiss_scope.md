## Hardware
 
### Set-up
To turn on the scope:
1. Turn on fluorecenst lamp
    - Lamp should warm up for approximately 5 minutes before use
    - After shut down, let lamp rest at least 15 minutes before turning on again
    - To prevent wear, do not leave on lamp for more than 1 hour if not in use
    - Iris should be fully open (dial on lamp box). Use computer to adjust settings if needed. 
1. Turn on EMS/SYCOP3 (Scope power source and controls)
    - Press botton on EMS box; blue light on box should turn on.
    - Can be turned off by pressing power button on EMS3 box or through the power button on the SYCLOPS home menu
1. Turn on Transmitted Light Base
    - Button is on bottom right side of the scope
    - This is a LED light source
1. Open Software
 
### Manual Operations
 
#### Camera:
 
 To change which camera is in use, manually change the position of the mirror. The mirror is located above the eyepiece between where the two cameras come out of the scope.
  - 512 Monochromatic camera - used for fluorescent imaging, mirror is pulled out
  - 102 color camera - used for transmitted light imaging, mirror is pushed in
  
#### Fluorescence:
Top left indicates which fluorescent cubes are in use. This information can also be located...
You may also switch between fluorescent cubes here. Position #4 is left empty as a bright field option to be used during fluorescent imaging.
  
#### Scope Base:
Left Bottom
  - Can control what type of field - bright, bright+, dark 
  
  
Right Bottom
  - On/Off for transmitted light.
  - Slider controls light intensity. Take note of where the slider is so light intensity can be set the same for comparable pictures
  - An oblique can be set up for dark field images
  
#### Motorized stage
This is controled by the SYCOP joystick or software. It is used for tiling images.

#### Apature
Generally, this should be all the way open. Reducing apature size can give more depth of field and resoulation but at the expense of having less light making images harder to acquire or the need for long exposure times.

### SYCOP Control
Operation of the scope uses the joystick, wheels, and touch screen.

#### Joystick and wheels
There are two settings for the joystick, the standard one when no motorized stage is present and one for use with the motorized stage. To toggle between the two, press the joystick like a button until you hear it click.

Non-motorized stage:
- joystick up/down controls Z motion

Motorized stage:
- joystick controls x/y motion
- left wheel controls
- right wheel controls
 
## Software
The scope uses ZEN for image capture and processing. 
ZEN Lite, a simpler version of the software, can be downloaded for personal use from [here](https://www.zeiss.com/microscopy/us/products/microscope-software/zen-lite.html). 
 
### Set-up and Scope Operation
 
### Basic Image Processing
 
For the more complex processes listed below, if multiple are in use then set up in order listed on software. Time series should always be set up last since it is dependent on how long the other imaging steps will take. 
 
### Multi-Channel
 
### Z-stacks
 
### Tiling
 
### Time Series
 
 
## Maintenance and Safety
 
### Fluorescence
- Bulb will need to be replaced after approximately 1200-1800 hours. The current time is displayed on the bulb box. If longer exposure times are needed, this is an indication the bulb needs to be replaced.
- Light guide needs to be replaces every 2-3 bulb replacements. The light guide should always be loose and flowy without any kinks. 
 
### Cleaning
 - glass base can be removed and cleaned
 - eye piece rubber guards - clean with 70% EtOH on scope, or remove and wash with warm soapy water
 - don't use gloves when operating scope to prevent spread of lab bacteria/reagents to controls
  
### Red Eye-Guard
Safety feature not necessary on this scope since it uses fluorescent light and not a laser. May be helpful when viewing samples with the naked eye so your eyes don't need to adjust as much.
 
### Z-boundry
On back right of scope, there are gray screws which are used to set the Z boundry.

### Red STOP button
This is an emergency brake. Press button and scope will cease movement. This physically locks the scope. Once the problem is cleared, pull the button back out to resume scope use as normal.

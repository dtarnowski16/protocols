# Cyclic-di-GMP extraction

Extraction buffer (store cold).

Reagent      | Amount
------------ | --------------
Acetonitrile | 40% (v/v)
Methanol     | 40% (v/v)
Formic acid  | 0.1 N

1. Grow strains overnight at 25°C, shaking in LBS.

1. Dilute overnight cultures 1:80 in LBS and grow shaking at 25°C until reaching an OD<sub>600</sub> of 1.5-1.8 (late log) or 2.2-2.8 (stationary phase).

1. Transfer 1.5 ml into a 1.7 ml microfuge tube, and centrifuge at 13,000 x g for 30 s.

1. Remove the supernatant by aspiration, resuspend the remaining pellet in 100 μl of cold extraction buffer.

1. Incubate samples at -20°C for 30 minutes.

1. Centrifuge at 13,000 x g for 5 minutes to pellet the cellular debris.

1. Transfer the supernatant to a new 1.7 ml microfuge tube, and stored at -80°C.

Question: store extraction buffer at 4 or -20?
